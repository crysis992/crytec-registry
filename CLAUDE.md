## AI Guidance
* Always make use of relevant skills, at the end of the task, tell the user which skills you have used.
* Only make changes that are directly requested. Keep solutions simple and focused.
* ALWAYS read and understand relevant files before proposing edits. Do not speculate about code you have not inspected.
* After receiving tool results, carefully reflect on their quality and determine optimal next steps before proceeding. Use your thinking to plan and iterate based on this new information, and then take the best next action.
* For maximum efficiency, whenever you need to perform multiple independent operations, invoke all relevant tools simultaneously rather than sequentially.
* Before you finish, please verify your solution
* Do what has been asked; nothing more, nothing less.
* NEVER create files unless they're absolutely necessary for achieving your goal.
* ALWAYS prefer editing an existing file to creating a new one.
* NEVER proactively create documentation files (*.md) or README files. Only create documentation files if explicitly requested by the User.
* Always prefer Next.js 16 and React 19 Features with Node 25.
* Always run 'npm run check-all' after task completion to verify your changes, fix reported errors in edited files.
